# CDN Migration Summary: Classic to Standard Tier

## 📋 Overview

Successfully refactored the Azure CDN infrastructure from **Classic CDN** (`Standard_Microsoft`) to **Azure Front Door Standard tier** (`Standard_AzureFrontDoor`) using the modern Front Door resources.

## 🔄 Changes Made

### ✅ Resources Replaced

| **Old Resource** | **New Resource** | **Purpose** |
|------------------|------------------|-------------|
| `azurerm_cdn_profile` | `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile` | CDN Profile with Standard_AzureFrontDoor SKU |
| `azurerm_cdn_endpoint` | `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_endpoint` | CDN Endpoint |
| N/A | `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_origin_group` | Origin group with health probes and load balancing |
| N/A | `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_origin` | Origin pointing to Azure Storage static website |
| N/A | `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_route` | Route configuration with HTTPS redirect |

### 🚀 New Features Added

1. **Health Probes**: Automatic health monitoring with configurable intervals
2. **Load Balancing**: Advanced load balancing with latency and sample-based routing
3. **Enhanced Security**: Certificate name checking and HTTPS-only forwarding
4. **Improved Routing**: Pattern-based routing with HTTPS redirect enforcement
5. **Better Performance**: Standard tier provides better performance and more features

### 📊 Configuration Details

#### Front Door Profile
```hcl
resource "azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile" "resume_cdn" {
  name                = "${var.project_name}-frontdoor"
  resource_group_name = azurerm_resource_group.resume_rg.name
  sku_name            = "Standard_AzureFrontDoor"  # <- Standard tier
}
```

#### Origin Group with Health Probes
```hcl
health_probe {
  interval_in_seconds = 240
  path                = "/"
  protocol            = "Https"
  request_type        = "HEAD"
}

load_balancing {
  additional_latency_in_milliseconds = 50
  sample_size                        = 4
  successful_samples_required        = 3
}
```

#### Route with HTTPS Enforcement
```hcl
supported_protocols    = ["Http", "Https"]
patterns_to_match      = ["/*"]
forwarding_protocol    = "HttpsOnly"
https_redirect_enabled = true
```

## 📋 Terraform Plan Summary

### Resources to be Destroyed (2)
- ❌ `azurerm_cdn_profile.resume_cdn[0]` (Classic CDN Profile)
- ❌ `azurerm_cdn_endpoint.resume_cdn_endpoint[0]` (Classic CDN Endpoint)

### Resources to be Created (5)
- ✅ `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_profile.resume_cdn[0]` (Front Door Profile)
- ✅ `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_endpoint.resume_cdn_endpoint[0]` (Front Door Endpoint)
- ✅ `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_origin_group.resume_origin_group[0]` (Origin Group)
- ✅ `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_origin.resume_origin[0]` (Origin)
- ✅ `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_route.resume_route[0]` (Route)

### Updated Outputs
- `cdn_endpoint_url`: Will show new Front Door endpoint URL
- `frontdoor_profile_name`: New output for Front Door profile name
- `frontdoor_endpoint_fqdn`: New output for Front Door endpoint FQDN

## 🚀 Benefits of Migration

### Performance Improvements
- **Global Edge Locations**: Better global performance with Azure Front Door
- **Advanced Caching**: More sophisticated caching strategies
- **Load Balancing**: Intelligent traffic distribution

### Security Enhancements
- **WAF Integration**: Web Application Firewall support (can be added later)
- **Certificate Management**: Enhanced SSL/TLS certificate handling
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: Built-in HTTPS redirect and enforcement

### Monitoring & Diagnostics
- **Health Probes**: Automatic endpoint health monitoring
- **Advanced Metrics**: Better monitoring and analytics
- **Real-time Diagnostics**: Enhanced troubleshooting capabilities

## 📝 Deployment Steps

1. **Validate Configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```

2. **Review Plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

3. **Apply Changes**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

4. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Check Front Door endpoint URL in outputs
   - Test website accessibility through new CDN endpoint
   - Verify HTTPS redirect functionality

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Downtime Considerations
- **Brief Service Interruption**: There will be a short period where the old CDN is destroyed before the new one is fully provisioned
- **DNS Propagation**: New Front Door endpoint may take a few minutes to become globally available
- **Cache Refresh**: Content may need to be re-cached at edge locations

### Cost Implications
- **Standard Tier Pricing**: Azure Front Door Standard tier has different pricing model
- **Additional Features**: New features like health probes and advanced routing included
- **Potential Savings**: May be more cost-effective depending on usage patterns

### Post-Migration Tasks
1. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**: Update any references to old CDN endpoint URLs
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check performance metrics after migration
3. **Custom Domain**: Configure custom domain if needed
4. **WAF Configuration**: Consider adding Web Application Firewall rules
